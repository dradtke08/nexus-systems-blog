## About Nexus Systems

Nexus Systems is an **AI-native software development company** building intelligent automation products for consumers, small businesses, and enterprises. Founded on the principle that artificial intelligence should be a core architectural component, not a bolted-on-feature. We're pioneering capital-efficient approaches to software development.

### Our Philosophy

We believe the future of software development lies in human-AI collaboration. Rather than treating AI as a productivity tool, we've built our entire company around AI-augmented workflows:

- **AI-Native Architecture**: Every system designed with AI integration from day one
- **Capital Efficiency**: Achieving enterprise-grade results with startup resources
- **Intelligent Automation**: Building products that learn and adapt
- **Governed Innovation**: Balancing rapid development with structured governance

### What We Build

**Windows System Intelligence**
Advanced PowerShell automation and system management tools that bring enterprise capabilities to organizations of all sizes.

**AI-Assisted Development Tools**
Frameworks and utilities that amplify developer productivity through intelligent code generation, documentation, and workflow automation.

**Knowledge Management Systems**

### Leadership

**David Radtke** — *CEO & Founder*

Building AI-native software development products with a focus on capital efficiency and intelligent automation. Passionate about demonstrating that solo founders with AI leverage can compete with traditional venture-backed teams.
